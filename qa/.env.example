# ComfyGit QA Docker Configuration
# Copy to .env and edit for your setup
#
# All paths must be accessible to the Docker daemon.
# In Docker-in-Docker setups, use HOST paths (not container paths).

# === Claude Authentication ===
# Path to .credentials.json file (not the directory)
# NOTE: Tilde (~) doesn't expand in docker-compose - use full path!
# Direct host: /home/YOURUSER/.claude/.credentials.json
# DinD/ACFS: /var/lib/docker/volumes/acfs-setup_claude-auth/_data/.credentials.json
# Or just set ANTHROPIC_API_KEY instead (no path needed)
CLAUDE_CREDS_PATH=/home/YOURUSER/.claude/.credentials.json

# Alternative: Use API key directly (no path needed)
# ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...

# === ComfyGit Repository ===
# Path to comfygit repo root (for local development)
# Direct host: .. (parent of qa directory)
# DinD: Full host path, e.g., /home/youruser/dev/projects/comfygit-ai/comfygit
COMFYGIT_PATH=..

# === QA Paths (optional, defaults work for direct host) ===
# Only set these if you need to override for DinD
# QA_REPORTS_PATH=./reports
# QA_SCENARIOS_PATH=./scenarios
# QA_INSTRUCTIONS_PATH=./agent_instructions

# === Example Configurations ===

# --- Direct Host (Linux/Mac) ---
# CLAUDE_CREDS_PATH=/home/youruser/.claude/.credentials.json
# COMFYGIT_PATH=..

# --- ACFS Docker-in-Docker ---
# Find your host dev path: docker inspect acfs-dev | grep '"Source".*dev"'
# CLAUDE_CREDS_PATH=/var/lib/docker/volumes/acfs-setup_claude-auth/_data/.credentials.json
# COMFYGIT_PATH=/home/youruser/dev/projects/comfygit-ai/comfygit
# QA_REPORTS_PATH=/home/youruser/dev/projects/comfygit-ai/comfygit/qa/reports
