Git for your ComfyUI environments — version control, package management, and reproducible sharing.

**Status:** Early release, actively developed. Feedback welcome via [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/comfygit-ai/comfygit/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/2h5rSTeh6Y).

## Highlights

- 🔄 **Isolated environments** — test new nodes without breaking production
- 📦 **Git-based versioning** — commit changes, rollback when things break
- 🚀 **One-command sharing** — export/import complete working environments
- 💾 **Smart model management** — shared model directory and content-oriented index
- 🔧 **Standard tooling** — built on UV and pyproject.toml, works with Python ecosystem
- 🖥️ **Cross-platform** — Windows, Linux, macOS

## How Is This Different From ComfyUI Manager?

ComfyUI Manager helps you browse, install, and update custom nodes in a single shared ComfyUI setup. ComfyGit focuses on **isolated, version-controlled environments** you can reproduce and share anywhere.

- **ComfyUI Manager:** manage nodes in-place (one environment)
- **ComfyGit:** create per-project environments with commits, branches, rollback, export/import

## Installation

```bash
# With UV (recommended)
uv tool install comfygit

# Or with pip
pip install comfygit
```

Need UV? See [UV installation](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

### Install from a source checkout

The monorepo root is a uv workspace. Install its matched packages with
`uv sync --frozen --all-packages`, then run `uv run --frozen --package comfygit cg ...`.
To expose the checkout as your user-installed CLI, run from the root:

```bash
uv tool install --force --editable ./packages/cli \
  --with-editable ./packages/core \
  --with-editable ./packages/studio-runtime
```

Rerun this command after dependency changes: editable source updates do not
refresh installed dependencies automatically. See the bundled skill's
[installation troubleshooting](skills/comfygit/references/installation.md) for
keyring and headless-host distinctions. Release-wheel dependency checks run
with `uv run python dev/scripts/check-package-install.py --python 3.10`.

### Agent skill

The reusable [ComfyGit skill](skills/comfygit/SKILL.md) covers environment/version
comparisons, shared models, node development and workflow validation with
progressively loaded references. Copy `skills/comfygit` into your agent's skill
directory (for Codex, `~/.codex/skills/comfygit`), or symlink it to this checkout
to follow local updates. Review an existing installed skill before replacing it.
Other agents can read `SKILL.md` directly. The skill is generic; configure local
workspace/model paths in your own agent instructions.

## Quick Start

```console
$ cg init
Initialized ComfyGit workspace at ~/comfygit

$ cg create my-project --use
Created environment 'my-project'
Active environment: my-project

$ cg node add comfyui-impact-pack
Resolving comfyui-impact-pack...
Installing ComfyUI-Impact-Pack from registry
 + comfyui-impact-pack@1.2.3

$ cg commit -m "Initial setup with Impact Pack"
[main a28f333] Initial setup with Impact Pack
 1 file changed, 15 insertions(+)

$ cg -e my-project run
Starting ComfyUI at http://localhost:8188
```

## What About My Existing Setup?

ComfyGit creates **new, isolated** ComfyUI environments inside your ComfyGit workspace. Your existing ComfyUI install (and anything in it) is **untouched**.

Models are stored once and **symlinked into environments**, so you can share the same model library across projects without duplicating storage.

Initial download size depends on the selected PyTorch backend and custom nodes;
GPU packages alone can require several gigabytes. uv caches can reuse package
artifacts, while each environment keeps its own mutable runtime.

See the [documentation](https://docs.comfygit.org/getting-started/installation/) for more examples including version control workflows, sharing environments, and team collaboration.

## Features

### Environments
```bash
cg create <name>              # Create new environment
cg list                       # List all environments
cg use <name>                 # Set active environment
cg status                     # Show environment state
cg run                        # Run ComfyUI
```

### Nodes
```bash
cg node add <id>              # Add from registry
cg node add <github-url>      # Add from GitHub
cg node remove <id>           # Remove node
cg node list                  # List installed nodes
```

### Version Control
```bash
cg commit -m "message"        # Save snapshot
cg log                        # View history
cg revert <commit>            # Undo a commit
cg checkout <commit>          # Explore old state
```

### Sharing
```bash
cg export <file.tar.gz>       # Export environment
cg import <file.tar.gz>       # Import environment
cg push / cg pull             # Sync with git remote
```
