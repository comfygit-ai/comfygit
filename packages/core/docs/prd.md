# ComfyDock System Specification v2.0

## Executive Summary

ComfyDock v2.0 implements a **two-tier reproducibility architecture** combining imperative local development with declarative environment packaging. The system focuses on environment reproducibility through careful tracking of workflows, custom nodes, models, and Python dependencies. ComfyUI workflows remain the source of truth, with changes tracked automatically through git-based versioning and environment bundling.

## Core Architecture

### Design Principles

1. **Two-Tier Reproducibility**: Local versioning (commit/rollback) for iteration, global packaging (export/import) for distribution
2. **Imperative Local Development**: Commands execute immediately (add downloads, remove deletes) - no deferred "sync" step
3. **Declarative Environment Packaging**: Export creates complete, reproducible environment definitions
4. **Lazy Resolution**: Model/node analysis only at commit/export time
5. **Git-Based Versioning**: Every commit creates a restorable snapshot
6. **Workspace Isolation**: Multiple environments with shared model index
7. **Filesystem-First Safety**: Never silently destroy user data; detect conflicts and require explicit confirmation
8. **Content-Addressable Models**: Models identified by hash, allowing flexible path remapping

### Architecture Summary

ComfyDock v2 implements a **two-tier reproducibility model** separating local iteration (git-based commit/rollback) from global distribution (export/import packages). See [Two-Tier Reproducibility Model](#two-tier-reproducibility-model) for details.

**Node Management Philosophy**:
- **Imperative**: Changes happen immediately (add downloads, remove deletes)
- **Filesystem-first**: Manual git clones respected, conflicts detected
- **Non-destructive**: Development nodes preserved with .disabled suffix
- **Three node types**: Registry (deletable), Git (deletable), Development (protected)

**Safety Mechanisms**:
1. Git conflict detection before any download
2. .disabled suffix preserves development nodes
3. Force flag required for destructive operations
4. Clear error messages with suggested fixes

## Key Concepts

### Environment
A complete ComfyUI installation with its own virtual environment, custom nodes, and workflow tracking. Each environment is isolated but shares the workspace's model index.

### Model Index
A workspace-wide SQLite database tracking all model files across a configured directory. Uses quick hash sample (Blake3 15MB from front/middle/end of file) for quick identification and full hashing (SHA256/Blake3) for verification.

**Hash Types:**
- **Quick Hash**: First/middle/last 15MB using Blake3 (fast identification)
- **Full Hash**: Complete file hash for export/import verification

### Workflow Tracking
Lightweight registration of workflows to monitor. No analysis occurs during tracking - just name registration in pyproject.toml.

### Model Resolution
The process of mapping workflow model references to actual files in the model index. Happens at resolve/commit/export time.

**Key Design Choice**: During local resolution, workflow JSON files are updated based on user's resolution choice(s). Mappings are stored in pyproject.toml using content-addressable hashes (i.e. model hash -> workflow json node location). This ensures shareability - workflows can be distributed with the user's original model/node paths intact. Then during import are workflow files rewritten to use local model paths.

See [Model Resolution Logic](#model-resolution-logic) for detailed strategy.

### Custom Node Management
Nodes are installed from ComfyUI registry or git repositories. Each node gets its own dependency group in pyproject.toml to isolate potential conflicts.

### Version Snapshots
Git commits that capture the complete environment state including workflows, dependencies, and model resolutions. Can be restored but changes are applied to current branch (not checkout).

### Two-Tier Reproducibility Model

ComfyDock provides two distinct levels of reproducibility for different use cases:

#### Local Reproducibility (commit/rollback)
**Purpose**: Personal version control for iteration and experimentation

**What's tracked**:
- pyproject.toml (node metadata including dev nodes, model references)
- uv.lock (Python dependency lockfile)
- .cec/workflows/ (workflow copies)

**What's NOT version-controlled**:
- Development node source code in custom_nodes/ (tracked in metadata but source managed by user's own git)
- Registry/git node binaries (downloaded separately on demand)
- Model files (too large, shared globally via model index)

**Use case**:
- Developer iterating on workflows
- Testing different node versions
- Rolling back problematic changes
- Local version history

**Workflow**:
```bash
$ comfydock commit -m "Added sampler"
$ # Make changes...
$ comfydock commit -m "Refined parameters"
$ # Oops, broke something
$ comfydock rollback v1  # Back to previous state
```

#### Global Reproducibility (export/import)
**Purpose**: Share complete working environments with others

**What's bundled**:
- pyproject.toml + uv.lock (Python dependencies)
- workflows/ (all workflow files)
- dev_nodes/ (full source of development nodes)

**What's referenced** (downloaded on import):
- Registry nodes (by ID + version)
- Github nodes (by repo URL + commit hash)
- Models (by hash + download URLs)

**Use case**:
- Sharing workflow templates
- Team collaboration
- Publishing environments
- Cross-machine reproducibility

**Workflow**:
```bash
# Developer creates environment
$ comfydock export my-workflow-v1.tar.gz
$ # Share package via file transfer

# Recipient imports
$ comfydock import my-workflow-v1.tar.gz
$ # Downloads missing nodes/models
$ # Environment ready to use
```

**Key Distinction**: Git tracks configuration changes over time (local history), while export creates a snapshot package for distribution (global sharing).

### Node Management Architecture

ComfyDock uses an **imperative, filesystem-first** approach to node management:

#### Core Principle
**Nodes are managed immediately on add/remove, NOT deferred to sync**

This differs from declarative package managers where changes are queued until sync. ComfyDock applies node changes immediately to:
1. Prevent user confusion (what you add is instantly present)
2. Allow manual filesystem manipulation (users can git clone nodes)
3. Respect existing data (never silently overwrite)

#### Node Addition Flow

```bash
$ comfydock node add comfyui-impact-pack
```

**What happens immediately**:
1. ✓ Check for filesystem conflicts (see Git Conflict Detection)
2. ✓ Resolve identifier (registry/GitHub)
3. ✓ Download node to custom_nodes/
4. ✓ Scan Python requirements
5. ✓ Add to pyproject.toml
6. ✓ Test dependency resolution
7. ✓ Sync Python virtual environment

**Result**: Node is PRESENT on filesystem and TRACKED in pyproject.toml

#### Node Removal Flow

```bash
$ comfydock node remove comfyui-impact-pack
```

**What happens immediately**:
1. ✓ Remove from pyproject.toml
2. ✓ Handle filesystem (see .disabled pattern)
3. ✓ Remove dependency group
4. ✓ Sync Python virtual environment

**Result**: Node is either .disabled or deleted from filesystem

#### Three Node Types

**1. Registry Nodes** (`source="registry"`)
- Downloaded from ComfyUI registry
- Cached globally for reuse
- Deleted on removal (can re-download from cache)
- Example: `comfydock node add comfyui-manager`

**2. Git Nodes** (`source="git"`)
- Cloned from GitHub URL
- Cached globally
- Deleted on removal (can re-clone)
- Example: `comfydock node add https://github.com/user/repo`

**3. Development Nodes** (`source="development"`)
- User's own nodes under active development
- Added via `--dev` flag
- **Protected from deletion** (uses .disabled pattern)
- Bundled in export packages
- Example: `comfydock node add my-node --dev`

#### Git Conflict Detection

**Problem**: Users often manually clone nodes, then try to add them via comfydock, leading to silent data loss.

**Solution**: Three-way conflict detection before any filesystem modification.

**Detection Flow**:
1. Resolve identifier → get expected node info
2. Check if directory exists in custom_nodes/
3. If exists: check git status, compare URLs, raise conflict error

**Conflict Scenarios**:

| Scenario | Condition | Resolution |
|----------|-----------|------------|
| **Regular directory** | Non-git directory exists | `--dev` to track, `--force` to replace |
| **Local git repo** | Git repo without remote | `--dev` to track, `--force` to replace |
| **Same repository** | Already cloned from same URL | `--dev` to track existing clone |
| **Different repos** | Name collision (different URLs) | Rename existing, or `--force` to replace |

**URL Normalization**: Intelligently compares git URLs (handles https://, git@, ssh:// protocols, ignores .git suffix, case-insensitive)

**Force Override**: `--force` flag bypasses all conflict detection and overwrites existing directory

#### .disabled Pattern (Non-Destructive Removal)

**Problem**: Deleting nodes permanently loses user data and git history.

**Solution**: Development nodes are preserved with `.disabled` suffix on removal.

**Behavior on `node remove`**:

**Development nodes**:
```bash
$ comfydock node remove my-dev-node
# custom_nodes/my-dev-node/ → custom_nodes/my-dev-node.disabled/
```
- Directory renamed, not deleted
- Git history preserved
- User data intact
- ComfyUI won't load it (doesn't end in expected name)

**Registry/Git nodes**:
```bash
$ comfydock node remove comfyui-manager
# custom_nodes/ComfyUI-Manager/ → DELETED
```
- Safe to delete (cached globally, can re-download)
- No user modifications expected

**Re-enabling nodes**:
```bash
$ comfydock node add my-dev-node
# Checks for .disabled version
# Removes my-dev-node.disabled/ before proceeding
```

**Rollback behavior**:
```bash
# v1: has node-a, node-b (dev), node-c
# v2: has node-a, node-c (removed node-b)
$ comfydock rollback v2
# → node-b.disabled/ created (not deleted!)
```

**Conflict handling**:
```bash
# If both exist:
# - custom_nodes/my-node/
# - custom_nodes/my-node.disabled/

$ comfydock node add my-node
# → Deletes my-node.disabled/ first
# → Then proceeds with fresh install
```

## Command Reference

- Shows workflow changes (added/modified/deleted)
- Lists node additions/removals
- Identifies model changes in workflows
- Displays uncommitted changes

**Output Example:**
```
Environment Status: test-env

Workflows:
  Modified: my_workflow.json
    - Models: 2 unresolved, 1 changed
  Added: new_workflow.json

Custom Nodes:
  Added: comfyui-impact-pack (not in last commit)

Changes ready to commit:
  - 2 workflow changes
  - 1 node addition

Run 'comfydock commit -m <message>' to resolve issues and save current state
Run 'comfydock workflow resolve my_workflow' to resolve workflow issues
```

### Node Management

> **See [Node Management Architecture](#node-management-architecture) for detailed behavior, conflict detection, and the .disabled pattern.**

#### `comfydock node add <identifier>`
Add a custom node to the environment.

**Identifier Types:**
- Registry ID: `comfyui-impact-pack`
- Registry ID with version: `comfyui-impact-pack@1.2.3`
- GitHub URL: `https://github.com/user/repo`
- Local directory name: `my-node` (with `--dev` flag)

**Options:**
- `--dev` - Track as development node
- `--no-test` - Skip Python dependency resolution testing
- `--force` - Force overwrite existing directory

**Examples:**
```bash
# Add registry node
$ comfydock node add comfyui-manager

# Add GitHub node
$ comfydock node add https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack

# Track existing directory as dev node (otherwise will download 'my-node' from registry)
$ comfydock node add my-node --dev
```

#### `comfydock node remove <identifier>`
Remove a custom node from the environment. Development nodes are preserved with `.disabled` suffix, registry/git nodes are deleted.

**Examples:**
```bash
$ comfydock node remove comfyui-manager      # Deletes from filesystem
$ comfydock node remove my-dev-node          # Renames to .disabled
```

#### `comfydock node list`
List all installed custom nodes.

**Options:**
- `--dev` - Show only development nodes
- `--registry` - Include registry metadata

### Workflow Management

> **MVP Behavior**: All workflows in the environment are automatically tracked. No manual track/untrack commands needed.

#### `comfydock workflow list`
List all workflows in the environment.

**Output:**
```
Workflows:
  ✓ my_workflow      (committed)
  ⚠ test_workflow    (modified since commit)
  ○ new_workflow     (not committed)
```

### Version Control

#### `comfydock commit [-m "<message>"]`
Create a version snapshot of the current environment state.

**Behavior:**
1. **Copy Workflows**: All tracked workflows copied from ComfyUI to .cec/workflows/
2. **Resolve Nodes + Models**: Parse workflows for nodes and model references and resolve against global node mappings table and model index (see [Model Resolution Logic](#model-resolution-logic))
3. **Update pyproject.toml**: Record resolved custom nodes, models with hashes and locations (node ID, widget index), and record workflow information with references/mappings to tracked models and custom nodes via content-addressed hashes and node IDs.
4. **Git Commit**: Create git commit with all changes

**Model Resolution**: Uses intelligent matching (exact path → directory-aware → similarity → interactive prompts). Previously resolved models are automatically reused from pyproject.toml.

#### `comfydock rollback <target>`
Restore environment to a previous state.

**Target Options:**
- Version tag: `v1`, `v2`, etc. (simple versioning)
- Commit hash: `abc123`
- Relative: `HEAD~1`
- Empty: Discard all uncommitted changes

**Behavior (Imperative - Complete Atomic Operation):**

Rollback is a single atomic operation that completely restores the environment:

1. **Snapshot Current State**:
   - Capture current node configuration before git changes it

2. **Git Operations**:
   - Apply historical state to current branch (NOT git checkout)
   - Restore pyproject.toml, uv.lock, .cec/workflows/

3. **Node Reconciliation** (with full context):
   - Compare old state vs new state (no guessing needed!)
   - **Remove nodes** that were deleted (registry/git → delete, dev → disable)
   - **Install nodes** that were added (from cache)
   - Context-aware: knows exactly what each node was

4. **Python Environment Sync**:
   - Run `uv sync` with restored uv.lock
   - Recreate virtual environment at exact historical state

5. **Workflow Restoration**:
   - Copy all workflows from .cec/ to ComfyUI/ (overwrite active)
   - Ensures workflows match committed state

**Key Improvements:**
- ✅ **No separate sync step** - rollback is complete
- ✅ **No git history heuristics** - has full context from snapshot
- ✅ **Atomic operation** - all or nothing
- ✅ **Workflows auto-synced** - no user confusion

**Important Notes:**
- Changes applied to current branch (can commit as new version)
- Development node source code NOT rolled back (user manages git)
- Rollback is reversible (can rollback to any version)

**Development Node Warning**:
```bash
$ comfydock rollback v1
⚠️  Development nodes are not version controlled:
   - my-dev-node (dependencies may have changed)

Suggestion: Check dev node requirements and run:
  comfydock node update my-dev-node
```

**Examples:**
```bash
# Rollback to previous version
$ comfydock rollback v1

# Discard uncommitted changes
$ comfydock rollback

# Rollback specific commit
$ comfydock rollback abc123

# Commit the rollback as new version
$ comfydock commit -m "Reverted workflow changes"
```

#### `comfydock log`
Show commit history for the environment.

**Options:**
- `--limit <n>` - Number of commits to show
- `--oneline` - Compact format

### Import/Export

#### `comfydock export <env_name>`
Create a distributable bundle of an environment with all dependencies.

**Options:**
- `--output <path>` - Output file path
- `--no-interactive` - Skip interactive model URL resolution

**Behavior:**
1. **Fresh Copy**: Copy latest workflow(s) from ComfyUI
2. **Full Analysis**: Extract model references, identify custom nodes, parse Python dependencies
3. **Model Resolution**: Generate full hashes, attempt API lookups (CivitAI, HuggingFace), prompt for unknown URLs (see [Model Resolution Logic](#model-resolution-logic))
4. **Bundle Creation**: Creates .tar.gz with pyproject.toml, uv.lock, workflows/, and dev_nodes/

## System Behaviors

### Workflow Lifecycle

#### Development Phase
```
1. User creates workflow in ComfyUI browser
2. User saves in ComfyUI (to disk)
3. User runs: comfydock status (sees workflow listed as 'new')
4. User commits: comfydock commit -m "New workflow" (resolves any issues and saves state)
5. User continues editing in browser
6. User adds nodes: comfydock node add <node>
7. User saves in ComfyUI again
8. User runs: comfydock status (sees workflow listed as 'modified', sees new node added)
9. User commits: comfydock commit -m "Added new sampler, node pack"
```

#### Distribution Phase
```
1. User exports: comfydock export my_env
2. System analyzes all dependencies
3. User provides missing URLs (model + node resolution logic)
4. Bundle created with all metadata
```

#### Consumption Phase
```
1. New user imports: comfydock import bundle.tar.gz
2. System checks for workflows/models/nodes
3. User approves downloads
4. Environment configured automatically
5. Workflow ready to run
```

### Model Resolution Logic

Model resolution happens at commit/export time to map workflow model references to actual files in the model index.

#### Resolution Hierarchy
For each model reference in a workflow:
1. **Check Cache**: If already resolved in pyproject.toml (same node ID + widget index + filename), reuse previous resolution
2. **Exact Match**: Full path matches exactly in model index
3. **Directory Context**: Node type implies directory (CheckpointLoaderSimple → checkpoints/, LoraLoader → loras/, VAELoader → vae/)
4. **Filename Match**: Same filename found in different path
5. **Interactive Prompt**: Multiple matches or no matches → ask user

#### Interactive Resolution
When multiple matches exist in the index or model not found:
```
Resolving model: "sd15.safetensors"
Multiple matches found:
  1. models/checkpoints/sd15.safetensors (4.2 GB)
  2. models/backup/sd15.safetensors (4.2 GB)
  3. models/test/sd15.safetensors (2.1 GB)

Select [1-3] or (s)kip: _
```

User selections are stored in pyproject.toml and reused in future commits (no re-prompting).

#### Hash Verification
- **Quick Hash**: Blake3 on first/middle/last 15MB for fast local lookups
- **Full Hash**: Complete SHA256 + Blake3 for export/import verification
- **API Lookup**: CivitAI, HuggingFace URL resolution (for export: URL to downloadable model)

#### Edge Case: Model File Deleted After Resolution
If a model is resolved and mapped in pyproject.toml, but the file is later deleted from disk:
1. The hash mapping remains in pyproject.toml (content-addressable design)
2. Next analysis detects the file is missing from the index
3. Model is marked as unresolved again
4. User must re-index (if file moved) or re-resolve (if permanently gone)

This ensures the system never assumes a mapping is valid without verifying the file exists.

### Custom Node Isolation

Each custom node gets its own dependency group:
```toml
[dependency-groups]
comfyui-core = ["torch>=2.0", "numpy", "pillow"]

# Each node isolated with name/id + differentiating hash (to prevent namespace conflicts)
"comfyui-impact-pack-82dd0cec" = ["opencv-python>=4.5"]
"comfyui-animatediff-911dec51" = ["einops>=0.6"]

[tool.comfydock.nodes]
"comfyui-impact-pack" = {
    name = "ComfyUI-Impact-Pack"
    registry_id = "comfyui-impact-pack"
    version = "4.1.8",
    download_url = "https://cdn.comfy.org/..."
    source = "registry",
}
```

### Git Integration

#### Commit Structure
```
.cec/
├── .git/                  # Git repository
├── workflows/             # Tracked workflow copies
│   └── my_workflow.json
├── pyproject.toml         # Dependencies and config
└── uv.lock                # Python lockfile
```

#### Rollback Behavior
- **NOT** a git checkout (stays on current branch)
- Applies historical state as new changes
- Shows as modifications in `git status`
- Can be committed as new version

### Development Nodes

Development nodes are bundled with exports:
```
bundle.tar.gz
├── pyproject.toml
├── workflows/
└── dev_nodes/
    └── my-custom-node/    # Full source included
        ├── __init__.py
        ├── nodes.py
        └── requirements.txt
```

### .comfydock_ignore

Users can specify a .comfydock_ignore file under their environment's .cec/ which will:
- Allow for specific custom nodes to be ignored by the system (both tracking and disabling etc.)
- Allow for specific workflows to be ignored from tracking (wont be copied to and from .cec/workflows)

CLI commands can be made to help manage workflows/nodes that are ignored (FUTURE ENHANCEMENT)

## Data Structures

```

### Model Index Schema (SQLite)

**models** - One entry per unique model file (by hash)
- `hash` (PK): Quick hash
- `file_size`, `sha256_hash`, `blake3_hash`: File info
- `last_modified`, `indexed_at`: Timestamps
- `metadata`: JSON blob

**model_locations** - All instances of each model in tracked directory

```

### Workspace Metadata
We store workspace-level configuration details under workspace/.metadata/workspace.json
File structure example:
```json
{
  "version": 1,
  "active_environment": "test1",
  "created_at": "2025-09-14T19:34:46.840921",
  "global_model_directory": {
    "path": "/home/<user>/ComfyUI/models",
    "added_at": "2025-09-15T22:40:32.846419",
    "last_sync": "2025-09-15T22:40:32.846423"
  }
}
```
Currently workspace config includes:
- Which environment is currently 'active' (via use command)
- Path to the global model directory on the host machine (set up at init or using config command)

### Error Recovery

#### Failed Node Installation
- Custom node fails to resolve dependencies in test environment
- Warn user with about failed resolution
- Keep downloaded node in cache
- User can modify python dependencies in pyproject.toml and try install again
- User can choose to force add node + dependencies to pyproject without resolution testing via --no-test

#### Model Resolution Conflicts
- Present all options to user
- Allow skipping
- Mark as unresolved in pyproject.toml
- Continue with rest of workflow

#### Rollback Failures
- Keep current state intact
- Show what couldn't be restored
- Suggest manual fixes
- Never leave broken environment

### Performance Optimizations

#### Model Indexing
- Parallel hashing for large directories
- Incremental updates (only new/modified files)
- Cache hash results in SQLite

#### Node Caching
- Global cache across all environments
- Content-addressed storage
- Compression for space efficiency

#### Resolution Testing
- Cached resolution results
- Skip tests with --no-test flag
- Batch multiple changes

## User Workflows

### Starting Fresh

```bash
# Initialize workspace
comfydock init ~/my-workspace # Enters interactive setup unless user specifies --no-interactive
# Prompts user to specify global models directory path
# Asks user if they'd like to migrate/import an existing ComfyUI installation
# On complete: export COMFYDOCK_HOME pointing at new workspace (defaults to ~/comfydock_workspace if no path specified via init <path>)

# Create first environment
comfydock create test-env --python 3.11

# Start working
comfydock run
```

### Daily Development

```bash
# Add custom node
comfydock node add comfyui-impact-pack

# TODO: Track workflow (FUTURE ENHANCEMENT)
# comfydock workflow track my_workflow

# Work in ComfyUI browser...

# Commit changes
comfydock commit -m "Added impact pack and new workflow"

# Continue working...

# Check status
comfydock status

# Commit again
comfydock commit -m "Refined sampler settings"
```

### Sharing Work

```bash
# Export workflow
comfydock export my_workflow

# Answer prompts for model URLs (if needed)
# → Creates my_workflow_bundle.tar.gz

# Share bundle file
```

### Receiving Work

```bash
# Import shared bundle, set name as "imported", set as active
comfydock import shared_workflow.tar.gz --name imported --use

# Approve model downloads
# Wait for setup...

# Run imported workflow
comfydock run
```

### Version Management

```bash
# View history
comfydock log --limit 10

# Outputs (e.g.): 
# Version history for environment 'test1':
# v2: Updated workflow
# v1: Initial environment setup
# Use 'comfydock rollback <version>' to restore to a specific version

# Rollback to previous
comfydock rollback

# Or to specific commit
comfydock rollback v1 # Currently organizing commits with simple v<num> (v1, v2, etc.)

# Status shows rollback changes
comfydock status

# Commit rollback as new version
comfydock commit -m "Reverted to previous sampler"
```

## Future Enhancements

### Phase 2 Features
- Workflow diffing between versions
- Batch workflow operations
- Model download queue management
- Custom node version upgrades
- Workspace templates

### Phase 3 Features
- Cloud model registry integration
- Workflow testing automation
- Dependency conflict auto-resolution
- Bundle signing and verification
- Multi-environment batch operations

## Migration Path

### From v1 (bidirectional sync)
1. Final sync in v1 (if applicable)
2. Upgrade ComfyDock
3. Run migration command
4. Verify workflows match
5. First commit in v2

### Breaking Changes
- No user-facing `sync` command (operations happen automatically)
- No workflow metadata injection
- Rollback behavior changed (applies changes vs checkout)
- Model resolution now lazy (at commit/export)
- Philosophy shift: imperative commands (immediate execution) vs declarative sync

## Implementation Status

### ✅ Implemented (MVP Complete)

**Node Management**:
- ✅ Imperative add/remove (immediate filesystem changes)
- ✅ Git conflict detection with URL normalization
- ✅ .disabled pattern for development node preservation
- ✅ --force flag for explicit overwrites
- ✅ Three node types (registry, git, development)
- ✅ Isolated dependency groups per node
- ✅ Development node requirement scanning

**Version Control**:
- ✅ Git-based commit/rollback for local versioning
- ✅ Workflow copying to .cec/
- ✅ pyproject.toml + uv.lock tracking
- ✅ Simple version tags (v1, v2, etc.)

**Safety Features**:
- ✅ Filesystem conflict detection
- ✅ Non-destructive .disabled suffix
- ✅ Clear error messages with suggestions
- ✅ Protected development nodes

**Background Operations** (Automatic):
- ✅ Python package reconciliation (`uv sync` - automatic after node changes)
- ✅ Node reconciliation (install missing, disable extra during rollback)
- ✅ Model path synchronization (background updates, no user sync command)

### 🚧 In Progress

**Export/Import**:
- ⚠️ Export command structure defined (not fully implemented)

**Code Quality**:
- ⚠️ Obsolete test cleanup (3 tests reference removed methods)
- ⚠️ Error message consistency audit
- ⚠️ Logging standardization

## Summary

ComfyDock v2.0 implements a **two-tier reproducibility model** that separates local iteration from global distribution. The architecture embraces an **imperative, filesystem-first** approach to node management that respects user data and manual interventions.

Key innovations:
1. **Git for iteration**: Fast local versioning without tracking binary data
2. **Packages for distribution**: Complete reproducibility for sharing
3. **Conflict detection**: Never silently destroys user data
4. **Protected dev nodes**: .disabled suffix preserves work in progress
5. **Three node types**: Clear distinction between registry, git, and development

The system provides robust reproducibility through git versioning and comprehensive dependency tracking while maintaining a clear, predictable data flow that matches user expectations.
