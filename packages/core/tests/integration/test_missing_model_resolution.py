"""Integration tests for missing model resolution with content-addressable design.

Tests verify the fuzzy search and hash-based mapping system for resolving
missing model references without modifying workflow JSON files.

DESIGN: Content-addressable model resolution
- Workflow JSON files are NEVER modified during local resolution
- Models mapped via hash in pyproject.toml
- Fuzzy search against existing model index
- Original workflow references preserved for shareability

CURRENT STATUS: Most tests will fail - they document expected behavior.
Use TDD approach: make tests pass incrementally.
