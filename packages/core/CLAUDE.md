## Python Environment Management

- ALWAYS use uv and the commands below for python environment management! NEVER try to run the system python!
- uv commands should be run in the root repo directory in order to use the repo's .venv

### Development

- `uv add <package>` - Install dependencies
- `uv run ruff check --fix` - Lint and auto-fix with ruff
- `uv pip list` - View dependencies
- `uv run <command>` - Run cli tools locally installed (e.g. uv run comfydock)

### Testing

- Always put new unit tests under tests/unit directory!
- Try to add new tests to existing test files rather than creating new files (unless necessary)
- `uv run pytest tests/` - Run all tests
- `uv run pytest <filename>` - Run specific test file

#### Testing comfydock cli
- Use the existing testing workspace by prepending the env variable to cli commands:
COMFYDOCK_HOME=/home/akatzfey/projects/comfydock/comfydock-new/packages/cec/.comfydock_workspace

## General
Don't make any implementation overly complex. This is a one-person dev MVP project.
We are still pre-customer - any unnecessary fallbacks, unnecessary versioning, testing overkill should be avoided.
Simple, elegant, maintainable code is the goal.
We DONT want any legacy or backwards compatible code.
