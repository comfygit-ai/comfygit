# Serve API Reference

`cg serve` hosts Studio and contract-shaped HTTP endpoints for a ComfyGit
environment. It fronts an already running ComfyUI server or a configured proxy
executor.

Start ComfyUI first:

```bash
cg run
```

Then start the serve front door:

```bash
cg serve --port 8190 --comfy-url http://127.0.0.1:8188
```

## Studio And Health

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/` | Studio UI |
| `GET` | `/openapi.json` | OpenAPI document for the public contract API |
| `GET` | `/health` | Serve and backend health |

## Contracts

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/contracts` | List available workflow contracts |
| `GET` | `/contracts/{workflow}/{contract}` | Show one contract |
| `POST` | `/contracts/{workflow}/{contract}/run` | Start a contract run |

Run requests use the public input names defined by the workflow contract. File
inputs should use upload references rather than inline file bytes.

Contract reads share a short environment read lock. Run preparation captures
the manifest and API prompt together, then releases the lock before execution.
Contract responses include `manifest_revision`; run responses also include a
`prompt_digest` for the prepared prompt and a `request_id` for log correlation.
These identify the captured inputs, not a guarantee that a live environment can
be upgraded safely while generation is running.

If an environment mutation is active, these routes return HTTP **503** with
`error: "environment_busy"`, `retryable: true`, `Retry-After: 1`, and
`X-Request-ID`. The JSON includes the request ID and best-effort owner PID,
operation, and acquisition time. No generation has been submitted for this
response. Queue owners can retain the job and retry readiness after backoff.
Other errors, including generic HTTP 500 responses, do not prove lock contention.

Retry read-only GET requests within a bounded deadline. Never automatically
replay a POST whose submission outcome is unknown. Inspect run records first.
Do not delete `.comfygit.lock` as a contention fix; an existing file alone does
not mean a lock is held.

## Uploads

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/uploads/prepare` | Create an upload slot |
| `PUT` | `/uploads/{upload_id}` | Upload file bytes to the slot |
| `GET` | `/uploads/{upload_id}/status` | Check upload status and receive `file_ref` |

Use the returned `file_ref` in contract run requests.

## Runs And Outputs

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/runs` | List serve run records |
| `GET` | `/runs/{run_id}` | Inspect one run |
| `POST` | `/runs/{run_id}/cancel` | Cancel a run |
| `GET` | `/outputs/view` | Fetch a serve output artifact |

## Gallery

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/gallery` | List gallery items for the current serve state |
| `DELETE` | `/gallery/{item_id}` | Delete a gallery item |

`GET /gallery` returns all items when no pagination query is supplied. New
clients should prefer cursor pagination:

```text
GET /gallery?limit=50
GET /gallery?limit=50&cursor=<next_cursor>
```

Paginated responses include `items`, `next_cursor`, `has_more`, `session_id`,
and `gallery`.

## Proxy Runtime Endpoints

When `cg serve --role proxy` is used, the proxy runtime exposes compute-facing
routes under `/proxy`.

| Method | Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/proxy/health` | Proxy runtime health |
| `POST` | `/proxy/runs` | Start a proxy run |
| `GET` | `/proxy/runs/{prompt_id}` | Inspect a proxy run |
| `POST` | `/proxy/runs/{prompt_id}/cancel` | Cancel a proxy run |
| `GET` | `/proxy/artifacts/{artifact_id}` | Fetch a proxy artifact |

The proxy routes are runtime plumbing. Most local users interact with Studio or
the front-door contract endpoints instead.
