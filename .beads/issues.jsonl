{"id":"cg-55e","title":"status command makes unnecessary API calls for legacy manager check","description":"The CLI status command calls _show_legacy_manager_notice() which calls env.get_manager_status(). This method fetches latest_version from the live registry API (~1.2s), but the status command only uses the is_legacy field (a local symlink check). Fix: either inline the symlink check in _show_legacy_manager_notice(), or add a lightweight is_legacy_manager() method that skips the API call.","status":"open","priority":2,"issue_type":"bug","created_at":"2025-12-29T18:09:21.456171199-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2025-12-30T03:05:57.904680601-05:00"}
{"id":"cg-pnm","title":"Design agent-based QA testing system","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nComfyGit has complex multi-step user flows that unit/integration tests don't fully capture:\n- Workspaces with multiple environments\n- Collaborator sync via push/pull\n- Import/export workflows\n- Workflow resolution with node conflicts\n- Model resolution across sources\n\nManual testing doesn't scale. Users report bugs involving complex command sequences that are hard to replicate in traditional pytest fixtures.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAgent-based QA testing in reproducible containers:\n1. **Nix/Docker images** with deterministic starting state\n2. **Claude Haiku/Sonnet agents** executing test scenarios via CLI\n3. **Structured reports** documenting findings and UX issues\n4. **Parallel execution** (5+ agents) for cost efficiency\n5. **Future: UI testing** inside ComfyUI container\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n### Agents for Discovery, Pytest for Regression\n- Agents explore and find bugs (non-deterministic)\n- Once found, convert to deterministic integration tests\n- Don't use agents as CI gates (too slow/expensive)\n\n### Scenario-Based Execution\nDefine scenarios in YAML that agents execute:\n```yaml\nname: Collaborator sync with conflicting node versions\nsteps:\n  - setup: create_workspace --name test-collab\n  - action: node add comfyui-manager==1.0.0\n  - action: git push origin main\n  - setup: simulate_collaborator_push\n  - action: git pull\n  - assert: should_detect_conflict\n```\n\n### Cost Model\n- Haiku: ~$0.25/M input, ~$1.25/M output\n- Target: ~$1-5 per comprehensive test run\n- Run weekly or on-demand, not every commit\n\n## Proposed Directory Structure\n\n```\nqa/\n├── Dockerfile              # Base image: comfygit, claude, uv, git\n├── nix/\n│   └── qa-env.nix          # Optional stricter reproducibility\n├── scenarios/\n│   ├── workflow_sync.yaml\n│   ├── node_conflict.yaml\n│   └── model_resolution.yaml\n├── agent_instructions/\n│   ├── base_system.md      # Core agent behavior\n│   ├── scenario_runner.md  # How to execute scenarios\n│   └── report_format.md    # Required output structure\n├── reports/\n│   └── {timestamp}_{scenario}_{agent_id}.md\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── run_qa.py           # Orchestrate agent containers\n│   ├── parse_reports.py    # Aggregate findings\n│   └── generate_tests.py   # Convert findings to pytest\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Existing Infrastructure to Build On\n\n- `dev/docker-compose.yml` - Existing Docker setup with GPU support\n- `dev/scripts/cross-platform-test.py` - Parallel test orchestration pattern\n- `packages/core/tests/conftest.py` - 500+ lines of fixtures\n- `packages/core/tests/helpers/` - Fluent test builders (WorkflowBuilder, etc.)\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Proof of Concept\n- [ ] Single scenario, single agent, manual triggering\n- [ ] Basic Dockerfile extending existing dev setup\n- [ ] Simple report format (markdown)\n- [ ] Validate: does agent find real bugs?\n\n### Phase 2: Structure\n- [ ] Scenario YAML DSL design\n- [ ] Structured report format (JSON + markdown)\n- [ ] Agent instruction engineering\n- [ ] Orchestration script\n\n### Phase 3: Scale\n- [ ] Parallel agent execution\n- [ ] Report aggregation and analysis\n- [ ] Integration test generation from findings\n- [ ] Weekly automated runs\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should scenarios be purely declarative or allow agent exploration?\n2. How much ComfyUI setup is needed in containers?\n3. Should we use Nix from the start or defer?\n4. How to handle agent-found bugs that can't be reproduced?\n\n## References\n\n- Discussion context: Agent-based QA testing strategy\n- Existing test stats: ~17K lines integration tests, 90+ tests in core\n- Cross-platform support: Linux, Windows, macOS via SSH","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-30T02:39:42.649127688-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2025-12-30T03:05:57.904312406-05:00"}

Made a change (added comment to cg-55e)\n2. Ran `bd sync --verbose`\n3. Output showed 'No changes to commit'\n4. But `diff .beads/issues.jsonl .git/beads-worktrees/beads-sync/.beads/issues.jsonl` showed differences\n5. Had to manually copy and push:\n   ```bash\n   cp .beads/issues.jsonl .git/beads-worktrees/beads-sync/.beads/\n   cd .git/beads-worktrees/beads-sync\n   git add .beads/issues.jsonl \u0026\u0026 git commit -m 'sync: ...' \u0026\u0026 git push\n   ```\n\n## Environment\n\n- bd version: (check with `bd --version`)\n- Config: `sync-branch: beads-sync` in .beads/config.yaml\n- Worktree exists at: `.git/beads-worktrees/beads-sync`\n\n## Possible Causes\n\n1. Export hash tracking is out of sync (we saw 'JSONL file hash mismatch' warning)\n2. bd is comparing wrong files or using stale hashes\n3. The worktree copy step in sync is not working\n\n## Workaround\n\nManual sync after beads changes:\n```bash\ncp .beads/issues.jsonl .git/beads-worktrees/beads-sync/.beads/\ncd .git/beads-worktrees/beads-sync\ngit add .beads/ \u0026\u0026 git commit -m 'sync: msg' \u0026\u0026 git push origin beads-sync\n```\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. Check bd source code for sync logic\n2. Try `bd sync` with different flags\n3.
