{"id":"cg-pnm","title":"Design agent-based QA testing system","description":"## Problem Statement\n\nComfyGit has complex multi-step user flows that unit/integration tests don't fully capture:\n- Workspaces with multiple environments\n- Collaborator sync via push/pull\n- Import/export workflows\n- Workflow resolution with node conflicts\n- Model resolution across sources\n\nManual testing doesn't scale. Users report bugs involving complex command sequences that are hard to replicate in traditional pytest fixtures.\n\n## Proposed Solution\n\nAgent-based QA testing in reproducible containers:\n1. **Nix/Docker images** with deterministic starting state\n2. **Claude Haiku/Sonnet agents** executing test scenarios via CLI\n3. **Structured reports** documenting findings and UX issues\n4. **Parallel execution** (5+ agents) for cost efficiency\n5. **Future: UI testing** inside ComfyUI container\n\n## Key Design Decisions\n\n### Agents for Discovery, Pytest for Regression\n- Agents explore and find bugs (non-deterministic)\n- Once found, convert to deterministic integration tests\n- Don't use agents as CI gates (too slow/expensive)\n\n### Scenario-Based Execution\nDefine scenarios in YAML that agents execute:\n```yaml\nname: Collaborator sync with conflicting node versions\nsteps:\n  - setup: create_workspace --name test-collab\n  - action: node add comfyui-manager==1.0.0\n  - action: git push origin main\n  - setup: simulate_collaborator_push\n  - action: git pull\n  - assert: should_detect_conflict\n```\n\n### Cost Model\n- Haiku: ~$0.25/M input, ~$1.25/M output\n- Target: ~$1-5 per comprehensive test run\n- Run weekly or on-demand, not every commit\n\n## Proposed Directory Structure\n\n```\nqa/\n├── Dockerfile              # Base image: comfygit, claude, uv, git\n├── nix/\n│   └── qa-env.nix          # Optional stricter reproducibility\n├── scenarios/\n│   ├── workflow_sync.yaml\n│   ├── node_conflict.yaml\n│   └── model_resolution.yaml\n├── agent_instructions/\n│   ├── base_system.md      # Core agent behavior\n│   ├── scenario_runner.md  # How to execute scenarios\n│   └── report_format.md    # Required output structure\n├── reports/\n│   └── {timestamp}_{scenario}_{agent_id}.md\n├── scripts/\n│   ├── run_qa.py           # Orchestrate agent containers\n│   ├── parse_reports.py    # Aggregate findings\n│   └── generate_tests.py   # Convert findings to pytest\n└── README.md\n```\n\n## Existing Infrastructure to Build On\n\n- `dev/docker-compose.yml` - Existing Docker setup with GPU support\n- `dev/scripts/cross-platform-test.py` - Parallel test orchestration pattern\n- `packages/core/tests/conftest.py` - 500+ lines of fixtures\n- `packages/core/tests/helpers/` - Fluent test builders (WorkflowBuilder, etc.)\n\n## Implementation Phases\n\n### Phase 1: Proof of Concept\n- [ ] Single scenario, single agent, manual triggering\n- [ ] Basic Dockerfile extending existing dev setup\n- [ ] Simple report format (markdown)\n- [ ] Validate: does agent find real bugs?\n\n### Phase 2: Structure\n- [ ] Scenario YAML DSL design\n- [ ] Structured report format (JSON + markdown)\n- [ ] Agent instruction engineering\n- [ ] Orchestration script\n\n### Phase 3: Scale\n- [ ] Parallel agent execution\n- [ ] Report aggregation and analysis\n- [ ] Integration test generation from findings\n- [ ] Weekly automated runs\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should scenarios be purely declarative or allow agent exploration?\n2. How much ComfyUI setup is needed in containers?\n3. Should we use Nix from the start or defer?\n4. How to handle agent-found bugs that can't be reproduced?\n\n## References\n\n- Discussion context: Agent-based QA testing strategy\n- Existing test stats: ~17K lines integration tests, 90+ tests in core\n- Cross-platform support: Linux, Windows, macOS via SSH","status":"in_progress","priority":2,"issue_type":"epic","created_at":"2025-12-30T02:39:42.649127688-05:00","created_by":"ubuntu","updated_at":"2025-12-30T03:05:57.904312406-05:00","comments":[{"id":1,"issue_id":"cg-pnm","author":"ubuntu","text":"Restructured as epic with 3 phase tasks.
